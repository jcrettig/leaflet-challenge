# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

### Project Setup

1. Created a new repository for this project called `leaflet-challenge`. 

2. Cloned new repository to my computer.

3. Inside my local `leaflet-challenge` git repository, created a folder nameed **Leaflet-Step-1**.

4. Added **html** **css** and **Javascript** files to the repository. 

5. Pushed the above changes to GitHub.

### Level 1: Basic Visualization

1. Selected the 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days' data set from the USGS earthquake data located at [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php.

2. Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

3. Set data markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size.  Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger.   

3. Also set data markers to reflect the depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquake depths are noted on the legend as discussed below.

4. Included popups that provide magnitude, depth and location information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

5. Created a legend that provides ranges of depth by color.
   
### Additional items added to Visualization

1. Added a "Dark Map" layer to the visualization

2. Added a selection box in the top right corner to choose visualization options - "Street Map", "Dark Map", "Earthquakes" markers on or off.
